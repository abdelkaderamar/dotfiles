# dotfiles

This my Ubuntu dotfiles. The main script is `dotfiles.sh` and can be used with the following options:

- `-dry`: prints the command to execute instead of running them.
- `-dir`: create directories structure. 
- `-apt`: installs software using *apt* sources.
- `-soft`: installs some additional softwares.
- `-dev`: installs some development tools.
- `-all`: activate all other options except `-dry' one.

The script installs some bash scripts. Their documentation can be found [here](scripts/README.md)
